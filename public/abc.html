    <p><a href="https://www.icann.org/">ICANN's</a> mission is to help ensure a stable, secure, and unified global
        Internet. To reach another person on the Internet, you need to type an address – a name or a number – into your
        computer or other device. That address must be unique so computers know where to find each
        other.&nbsp;ICANN&nbsp;helps coordinate and support these &ldquo;unique identifiers&rdquo; across the
        world.&nbsp;ICANN&nbsp;was formed in 1998 as a not-for-profit public-benefit corporation with a community of
        participants from all over the world.</p>
